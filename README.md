This photo was taken in Jeju, South Korea in 2018, a really stressful and tiring year as I was adjusting to my new military life back home. My family had decided to go for a holiday in South Korea and it was the perfect break that I needed. The scene pictured here was taken near the top of Hallasan, the highest mountain in South Korea.

It took us 4 hours to walk up the mountain, but it was well worth the effort because the scenery was just peaceful. To me, it was the gateway to a place where I could let go of all my worries and stress, where I could just sit there and take in the vast nature surrounding me. Walking across the trail was a calming journey, without the everyday buzz of cars, dull scenes of concrete and glass, and the blaring noise of the city life I was so used to. Feeling the cool breeze and hearing the silent voice of nature gave me the revitalizing energy that I had been yearning for.

This experience put things into perspective for me â€” imagining myself as a tiny little speck on this vast mountain helped me get through the hardships I was going through, by reminding myself that life had so much more than my worries and hardships. I come back to this photograph every now and then as it provides a sense of relief, something to look forward to when the daily hustle of life becomes an overbearing force. A portal to peace and quiet.
